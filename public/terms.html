action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be
one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data

authorised by the data subject.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;color:#565C70;letter-spacing:

2. Data quality and proportionality: Personal data must be accurate and, where
necessary, kept up to date. The personal data must be adequate, relevant and
not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and
further processed.&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;color:#565C70;letter-spacing:

3. Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to
ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing
and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the
data exporter.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Lato",sans-serif;color:#565C70;letter-spacing:
.4pt'><br>
4. Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures
must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as
against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration,
unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing. Any person
acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must
not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.</span></p>

.4pt'>5. Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided
in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC, data subjects must, whether directly or
via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an
organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on
unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or
for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data
exporter. Provided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need
also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the
interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data
importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental
rights and freedoms of the data subject. The sources of the personal data need
not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the
rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Data subjects
must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or
deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles. If there
are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation
may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification,
amendment or deletion. Notification of any rectification, amendment or deletion
to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when
this involves a disproportionate effort. A data subject must also be able to
object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are
compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation. The burden
of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may
always challenge a refusal before the authority.</span></p>
