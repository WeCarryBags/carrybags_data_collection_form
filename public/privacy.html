To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider
the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of
harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
